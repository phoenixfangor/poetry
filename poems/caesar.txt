The Soliloquy of Marc Antony After Caesar Was Murdered
------------------------------------------------------

Oh pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
Bad stuff is going to go down in people's arms and legs
Like everything in the whole country will be bad
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
